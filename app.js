      "Do you have your own longitudinal panel data ready to work with?",
    explanation:
      "Both pipelines expect a long-format data frame — one row per respondent per wave — " +
      "with a respondent identifier column and a wave or time column. " +
      "If you do not have real data yet, weasel can generate a synthetic panel " +
      "with realistic missingness patterns so you can learn or prototype a workflow first.",

    question:
      "Do you want to explore participation patterns before deciding on a selection rule?",
    explanation:
      "The Scope pipeline maps which respondents were observed at which waves and groups " +
      "them into participation fingerprints. This is useful when you do not yet have a " +
      "clear selection rule in mind and want to understand the missingness landscape first. " +
      "If you already know the structural criteria you want to apply — required endpoints, " +
      "a missingness tolerance, a gap limit — you can go directly to the Plan pipeline.",
    yes: { label: "Yes, I want to map patterns first", next: "scope_range" },
    no: {
      label: "No, I want to construct a sample directly",

  dummy_purpose: {
    type: "question",
    shortLabel: "Full demo",
    question:
      "Do you want a single guided demonstration that covers the entire package?",
    explanation:
      "weasel_example() runs both pipelines on a 1 000-respondent synthetic panel, prints " +
      "all intermediate outputs, and returns a named list of every key object. " +
      "It is the fastest way to verify your installation and see what the package produces. " +
      "If you would rather explore one pipeline in depth — stepping through each function " +
      "yourself — answer No.",
    yes: { label: "Yes, run the full demonstration", next: "result_demo" },

  },

  dummy_goal: {
    type: "question",
    shortLabel: "Dummy pipeline",
    question:
      "Do you want to explore the pattern-exploration pipeline (Scope) rather than the scenario-comparison pipeline (Plan)?",
    explanation:
      "The Scope pipeline focuses on understanding what patterns exist in the data: it groups " +
      "respondents by their wave fingerprint and lets you extract subsets for any pattern. " +
      "The Plan pipeline focuses on a different question: given a set of structural requirements, " +
      "which respondents qualify, and what is the trade-off between stringency and sample size?",
    yes: {
      label: "Yes, explore the Scope pipeline",

    no: { label: "No, explore the Plan pipeline", next: "result_plan_learn" },
  },

  scope_range: {
    type: "question",
    shortLabel: "Wave range",
    question: "Do you want to restrict the analysis to a specific wave range?",
    explanation:
      "Supplying an upper (and optionally a lower) bound to set_weasel_scope() limits " +
      "the presence matrix to a meaningful window. This makes the pattern table more " +
      "interpretable and avoids artefacts from sparse early or late waves. " +
      "If you are uncertain, a conservative upper bound is a sensible default; " +
      "you can always widen the window and re-run.",
    yes: {
      label: "Yes, I will set an upper or lower bound",
      next: "scope_gap",

  scope_gap: {
    type: "question",
    shortLabel: "Gap tolerance",
    question:
      "Do you want to include respondents who missed one or two waves within the window?",
    explanation:
      "Setting gap = 0 (the default) requires fully contiguous observation and produces " +
      "the cleanest, most easily interpretable pattern fingerprints. " +
      "Setting gap = 1 or gap = 2 retains respondents who skipped isolated waves but " +
      "otherwise participated consistently. The pattern table will be more complex, " +
      "but the respondent count will typically be higher.",
    yes: {
      label: "Yes, allow small gaps in participation",
      next: "result_scope_gap",
    },
    no: {
      label: "No, require contiguous observation only",

  plan_doc: {
    type: "question",
    shortLabel: "Methods documentation",
    question:
      "Do you need to formally document the selection in a methods section or pre-registration?",
    explanation:
      "weasel_justify_subset() generates a structured paragraph — in methods, concise, or " +
      "extended style — that documents the window bounds, structural constraints, resulting " +
      "sample size, and key coverage statistics, with optional in-text citation. " +
      "If you are writing a manuscript, registered report, or pre-registration where the " +
      "data-preparation stage must be reported transparently, answer Yes.",
    yes: {
      label: "Yes, I need a methods-section paragraph",
      next: "plan_span_justify",

    no: { label: "No, documentation is not required", next: "plan_span" },
  },

  plan_span_justify: {
    type: "question",
    shortLabel: "Fixed wave count",
    question:
      "Does your model require a fixed number of consecutive waves — for example, a growth-curve or latent-trajectory model?",
    explanation:
      'span = "core" asks weasel to locate the highest-coverage consecutive window of ' +
      "a specified length (core_len, default 6). This ensures every respondent in the " +
      "analysis is observed within the same bounded segment of the panel. " +
      'span = "full" includes every observed wave and is appropriate when the wave count ' +
      "need not be fixed — for example, in random-intercept models or survival analyses " +
      "where respondents can have different observation lengths.",
    yes: {
      label: "Yes, I need a fixed-length window",
      next: "result_plan_justify_core",

  },

  plan_span: {
    type: "question",
    shortLabel: "Fixed wave count",
    question: "Does your model require a fixed number of consecutive waves?",
    explanation:
      'span = "core" selects the densest consecutive window of fixed length. ' +
      "This is typically the right choice for growth-curve models or any design " +
      "where a uniform set of L waves per respondent is analytically important. " +
      'span = "full" covers all observed waves and gives you the widest longitudinal ' +
      "window at the cost of greater within-window missingness variability.",
